/* Use TDD to write function that takes in arabic numerals and 
 * returns the correct roman numeral.
 * Going up to 100 (e.g. 1 = I,  9 = IX, 10 = X, 11=XI, 20=XX, 21=XXI, 50 = L, 100 = C)
 *  1 = I, 2 = II, 3 = III, 4 = IV, 5 = V, 6= VI, VII, VIII, IX, X
 *   34 = XXXIV, 
 *
 *
 * 1) Write the test, let it fail.
 * 2) Write just enough to make it pass.
 * 3) Refactor - clean up, remove duplication, tidy it up.
 * 4) repeat
